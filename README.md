# Getting Started with Create React App

Welcome to the project! This React application was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with TypeScript as the template using the following command:

```shell
npx create-react-app online-store-challenge --template typescript
```

Below, you'll find all the necessary information to start working on and running the project.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:jsunecha/online-store-challenge.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd online-store-challenge
    ```

3. Install project dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   npm install
    ```

4. Install Additional Dependencies

    This project uses several external dependencies to enhance its functionality. You can install these dependencies using the following npm commands:
    ```shell
    npm install @mui/icons-material
    ```

    This package provides Material-UI icons for use in the project, adding visual elements to your components.

    ```shell
    npm install axios
    ```

    Axios is used for making HTTP requests to external APIs. It simplifies the process of fetching data from servers.

    ```shell
    npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
    ```

    These packages are part of the Material-UI framework and provide components, styling, and theming capabilities to create a beautiful and responsive user interface for your application.

5. Run the project

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
    Starts the development server and runs the app in development mode. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. The development server will automatically reload the app when you make edits, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.
